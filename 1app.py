# Word Problem: The School Portal Login System
# Your school is creating a new online portal for students to sign up for accounts. The login system needs a function that accepts two pieces of information from the user:
# Their email address
# Their password
# Before creating the new account, the function must verify that the email and password follow school rules:
# The email must be a string and must contain an "@" symbol.
# The password must also be a string.
# The password must be at least 8 characters long.
# The password must include at least one number.
# The password must include at least one uppercase letter.
# If ANY of these rules are broken, the function should return an error message explaining what went wrong.
# If EVERYTHING is good, the function should return a dictionary that represents the newly created user.

def valid(email,password):
    if "@" not in email:
        return "not in email format"
    if not isinstance(email,str) or not isinstance(password,str):
        return "invalid"
    

    
    if len(password) < 8:
        print("invalid password format")
   
    for i in password:
        if not any(i.isupper() for i in password):
                return"invalid password"

    for x in password:
        if not any(x.isupper() for x in password):
                return("invalid password")
    
    return{'email':email, 'password':password}
print(valid("test@gmail.com","passwordmustbestring"))
